# Transportation-with-Voronoia-diagram
An application that divides a cityâ€™s transport network using the co-ordinates on a map into a Voronoi diagram using various Computational Geometry libraries in Python. For n input points and v output vertices, the Qhull algorithm runs in O(n logv) in 2-D and 3-D.
